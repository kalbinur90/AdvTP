# AdvTP
Code and model for "Pattern Analysis and Applications"

## Introduction

This work presents a novel physical adversarial attack method — Adversarial Translucent Patch (ATP) — which leverages the unique properties of translucent materials to fool state-of-the-art object detectors in both digital and real-world environments. Unlike conventional patch-based attacks, ATP achieves a better trade-off between robustness and visual inconspicuousness, making it more practical for real-world deployment.
